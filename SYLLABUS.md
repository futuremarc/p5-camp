# SYLLABUS

## OVERVIEW

This course is an introduction to creative coding with the [p5.js](http://p5js.org) JavaScript Library. It will cover the basics of programming through: drawing and animating in the browser, designing and building interactivity, manipulating and animating page structure, audio synthesis on the web, and music visualization. We will be examples from the textbook [Learning Processing](https://github.com/shiffman/LearningProcessing-p5.js) by Daniel Shiffman.

* Code Blocks { }
	* `setup(){}` runs once in the beggining.

### CLASS 4: Conditionals

* Review
	* `Variables`
		* Declare, Initialize, Use
		* Built-in variables
	* Types
		* `Boolean`
		* `String`
		* `Number`
	* How to make something in the center of screen?
* [Conditionals](https://github.com/shiffman/LearningProcessing-p5.js/tree/master/chp05_conditionals)
	* Boolean expressions
		* I am hungry (true)
		* I am afraid of computer programming (false)
		* I am funny (false)
		* 15 is greater than 20 (false)
		* 5 equals 5 (true)
		* 32 is less than or equal to 33 (true)
	* Using a variable to take different paths in our program depending on the current value stored in the variable
		* x > 20 (depends on value of x)
		* y == 5 (depends on value of y)
		* z <= 33 (depends on value of z)
	* Operators
		* `< > >= <= == !=`
	* `If, else if, else`
		* Operate as questions
			* Allows us to execute certain instructions based on if the answer is `true` or `false`
			* If I am hungry then eat some food, otherwise if I am thirsty drink some water, otherwise take a nap
			* Pseudo Code
				* If the mouse is on the left side of the screen, draw a rectangle on the left side of the screen
					* `if (mouseX < width/2){
						fill(255);
						rect(0,0,width/2,height);
					}`
			* Can also be expanded by `else`
				* `if (mouseX < width/2){
					background(255);
				} else {
					background(0);
				}`
			* Can be further expanded by `else if`
				* `if (mouseX < width/3){
					background(255);
				} else if (mouseX < 2 * width/3){
					background(127);
				} else {
					background(0);
				}`
			* Grading system excercise
				* `var grade = random(0,100);
					if (___) {
						console.log('Assign letter grade A');
					} else if (___) {
						console.log('___');
					} else if (___) {
						console.log('___');
					} else if (___) {
						console.log('___');
					} else {
						console.log('___');
					}`
	* Logical Operators
		* `&& ||`
		* If my temperature is greater than 98.6 OR I have a rash on my arm, take me to see a doctor
		* If I am stung by a bee AND I am allergic to bees, take me to see the doctor
		* If the mouse is on the right side of the screen AND the mouse is on the bottom of the screen, draw a rectangle in the bottom right corner.
		* We could use a nested if statement, but it can be simpler with using the logical AND (`&&`)
		* If my temperature is NOT greater than 98.6, I won't call in sick to CoLab
		* If I am stung by a bee AND I am NOT allergic to bees, don't worry!
		* `if (mousePressed){
			ellipse(width/2, height/2, 100, 100);
		} else {
			rect(width/2, height/2, 100, 100);
		}`
	* `Boolean` variables
* **IN-CLASS**: Bouncing ball

### CLASS 5: Workshop 

* Review and discussion
* Workshopping
* [Singing Viz](https://github.com/futuremarc/p5-creative-coding-course/tree/master/exercises/singing-viz)

### CLASS 6: Loops
* Review
	* Let's make a bouncing ball
		* Let's take it further
* [Loops](https://github.com/shiffman/LearningProcessing-p5.js/tree/master/chp06_loops)
	* while
	* for
* What is iteration?
	* A generative process of repeating a set of rules or steps over and over again.
* Let's draw some legs
	* `stroke(0);
	line(50,60,50,80);
	line(60,60,60,80);
	line(70,60,70,80);
	line(80,60,80,80);
	line(90,60,90,80);
	line(100,60,100,80);
	line(110,60,110,80);
	line(120,60,120,80);
	line(130,60,130,80);
	line(140,60,140,80);
	line(150,60,150,80);`
		* How can we use variables to make some improvements and eliminate the hard-coded values? (we need legs' x, y locations, length, and spacing between the legs)
		* [Example](https://github.com/shiffman/LearningProcessing-p5.js/blob/master/chp06_loops/example_6_02_manylines2/sketch.js)
		* This is nicer, but doubles the amount of code!
* Loop structure is similar in syntax to a conditional, except instead of asking a true or false question to determine whether a block of code should be executed one time, our code will ask a true or false question to determine *how many times* the block of code should be *repeated*
* While loop, for loop
	* While loop
		* Instructions inside the while block continue to be executed over and over until the test condition becomes false.
		* [While loop example](https://github.com/shiffman/LearningProcessing-p5.js/blob/master/chp06_loops/example_6_03_whileloop/sketch.js)
		* [While loop circles](https://github.com/shiffman/LearningProcessing-p5.js/blob/master/chp06_loops/exercise_6_1b_while_circles/sketch.js)
		* Infinite loops are dangerous
	* For loop sets up conditions and increments altogether.
		* Common loops
			* Start at 0 and count up to 9
				* `for (var i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1){}`
			* Start at 0 and count up to 100 by 10
				* `for (var i = 0; i < 101; i = i + 10){}`
			* Start at 100 and count down to 0 by 5
				* `for (var i = 100; i >= 0; i = i - 5){}`
		* Initialization (first element of for loop) - A variable is declared and initialized for use within the body of the loop. This variable is most often used inside the loop as a counter.
		* Boolean test (middle element of for loop) - The same as the boolean tests found in conditional statements and while loops. It can be any expression that evaluates to true or false.
		* Iteration expression (last element of for loop) - An instruction you want to  happen with each loop cycle. It is executed at the end of each cycle through the loop.
		* `for (var i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1){}` Declare a variable i, while i is less than 10 repeat this code, at the end of each iteration add 1 to i.
			* Same thing as `int i =0; while (i < 10) {
			//do something
			i++;
			}`
		* [For loop example](https://github.com/shiffman/LearningProcessing-p5.js/blob/master/chp06_loops/example_6_06_forloop/sketch.js)
		* [For loop circles](https://github.com/shiffman/LearningProcessing-p5.js/blob/master/chp06_loops/exercise_6_2b_for_circles/sketch.js)
* Global and local variables
	* Global variables are declared at the top, outside of any code blocks
	* Variables inside code blocks cannot be used outside of that code block but can be used anywhere within it, even within another code block.
	* for loop uses local variable i, usually.
	* [Local var example](https://github.com/shiffman/LearningProcessing-p5.js/blob/master/chp06_loops/example_6_07_localvar/sketch.js)
	* [Draw is a loop](https://github.com/shiffman/LearningProcessing-p5.js/blob/master/chp06_loops/example_6_08_drawisaloop/sketch.js)
	* [Interactive loops](https://github.com/shiffman/LearningProcessing-p5.js/blob/master/chp06_loops/example_6_09_loop_mouse/sketch.js)
* `constrain()`
* `beginShape()` `endShape()`
* [`noise()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/noise)
